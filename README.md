# Portfolio website Pete Armitage

I wanted to collaborate with a Ironhack UX/UI design student to create a portfolio for both of us. 

We first created Pete's portfolio. [This](https://portfolio-pete-armitage.vercel.app/) is the beautifull result. 

The website was designed by Pete using Figma. I built it, based on the figma files, using React ⚛️.

It was a pleasure to work together with a UX/UI design student and to learn how they work and how crucial good planning and communication is in this process. 🧡
